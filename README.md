This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

The next step is to set custom align from outside. The idea is to use proptypes.shape which includes column align and row align.

Custom item shape should also be set. Like circle, margin, padding. And even later I should make item generic.
